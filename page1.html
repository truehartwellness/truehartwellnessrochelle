After 12 years in the holistic healing business and 5 years working as a licensed massage therapist, Rochelle decided that it was time for her to help as many people as possible at a price that everyone could afford. Starting off as "Truehart Massage", she owned a one-room business in Springfield, MA doing purely massage all on her own. </p><p>As her appointment book got further and further out she decided to expand the business and moved to a larger more established office where she could offer her customers even more in a more timely manner. Rochelle teamed up with her Husband and best friend (Licensed Massage Therapist and Hypnotist), Normand Truehart Lambert. &nbsp;</p><p>Together they developed what is now Truehart Wellness. Expanding beyond massage, Truehart Wellness offers Hypnosis, as well as countless in-depth relaxation techniques.</p></div>
